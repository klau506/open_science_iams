Metadata

"The attached table summarizes the survey results from thirteen modeling teams gathered in the IAM COMPACT [1] and DIAMOND [2] projects context. To protect respondent anonymity, certain answers have been withheld for confidentiality. Despite these omissions, the data offers valuable insights into the general trends, methodologies, and platforms used across different teams. The survey aims to enhance understanding of current open science practices within the integrated assessment modeling community, with a particular emphasis on documentation standards, data management strategies, and transparent modeling practices.

The survey was answered during July and Agust 2024 by the IAM COMPACT partners and during May 2025 by the DIAMOND partners."
